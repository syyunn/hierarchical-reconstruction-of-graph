# hierarchical-reconstruction-of-graph
Literatures on Hierarchical Reconstruction of Flat Graph With Given Perspective.

## Goals
Hierarchical Graph Reconstruction upon given scopic-interest
- e.g. “Please hierarchically reconstruct the given flat graph into the multi-level graph in terms of special interest group”

#### keyword
Hierarchical Pattern Discovery in Graphs

## Example

Query: "Let me see the graph in hierarchy upon the perspective of special interest"
Output" "Graphs that are multi-levelly pooled" + "Interpretibility of each level"
